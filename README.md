# [Eurole](https://eurole.onrender.com/)

Eurole is a Wordle-esque full stack web application that challenges the user to guess the secret Euroleague player, while helping him along  the way.
It is also a CRUD API that is made by me and is following an MVC architectural design pattern, neatly organised and easy to read. 
It utilizes localStorage to keep track of the users statistics after each game, and if the user wishes to, he can reset it.


# Tech stack

Tech used: HTML, CSS & JS. Node and Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

# Optimizations

While the project is considered finished and completely functional, media queries will be implemented to help people play the game on the go!

In addition, another thing that will be added is a login feature that will give the users extra benefits and possibly a new game mode in the near future. This would help with tracking the amount of users playing and more efficient Mongo implementation.

It is also intended to work the same way as Wordle, giving the user 6 tries and if he fails, he has to wait until midnight for the next one, but that will currently not be implemented in case people want to test the app a bit more and play around with it.
